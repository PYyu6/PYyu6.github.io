I am familar with Python and C. I am fluent in javascript, java and C++. I have experience using PyTorch and scikit-learn in computer vision and machine learning. Here are projects I would love to share

***

### Interactive Music Visualization

I created a new way to visualize melody and built it with ReactJS and firebase.
See the <a href="/2020/10/19/i-design-a-music-visualization/">post</a> about details and stories behind the app.
Check out<a href="https://vinyl-record-maker.web.app/"> live Demo</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/PYyu6/create-vinyl-record">code</a>

### Web App for Norweld Ltd

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/ftms.png)

I design and implement the function including recording multiple working sessions and modifying information for a specific task at the employee interface, using ReactJS and Java. When the user clicks the button Start-Pause, a new row in the table will be created and the start time will be displayed. When the button is clicked again, the end time will be displayed, and the duration will be calculated. When the user clicks the Stop button, the whole task will be ended, and a timesheet for this task will be generated. The user can go back to the home page and submit the timesheet to request task approval. When the user clicks the Modify Task Detail button, the task name and description can be modified.
