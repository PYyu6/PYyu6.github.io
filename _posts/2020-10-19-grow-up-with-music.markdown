Everyone tries to find a way to connect with the world. After attempting to use words, strokes, dancing moves... ... __I find that using musical notes is most suitable for me to express myself and understand others __ Music plays an important role in my life. I would love to share my musical experiences and thought with you :heartpulse:

## Instrument Market

I have played a musical instrument since I was 5. My first instrument is piano and I still play it sometimes. Later, I played the Pipa in my primary school's Chinese traditional instruments orchestra. In my junior and high school, I have joined the school's orchestra as a flautist. 

However, my favourite instrument is Cello. It is quite magical that I feel so connected with this instrument whenever I put the bow on the strings. There is a sense of ceremony when I check my body gesture. I need to sit straight and lift my arms to delightful sound. Also, I enjoy the sound frequencies the cello makes. Its sound is weighty yet powerful, so I could focus concentration on each note I want to play. This process makes me secured, calm and relaxed.

I would highly recommend the guitar if you are looking for an instrument to start your music journey. It is relatively easy to pick it up and you can get much fun to sing along. Moreover, the structure of a guitar allows you to learn quickly about different wonderful chords. It might inspire you to write your own melody!

## Music Style

Music is one's another diary. Just like nature v.s. nurture debate in psychology, there is a debate over lyrics and melody. Previously, I think lyrics is more important since good lyrics can excuse melody. Also, there is usually a pattern in melody even it is classical music. I usually get bored if I could easily predict the song.
However, I changed my mind when I touched LoFi Hip Hop, Emo, R&B, soul and Indie. You can rarely predict how the melody flows since there is riff component in these styles. I enjoy being laid back and chill when listening to these music pieces. My favourite artist is Dean. Check out his song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKyMIrBClYw">Instagram</a>.
