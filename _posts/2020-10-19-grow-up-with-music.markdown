Everyone tries to find a way to connect with a world. After attempting to use words, strokes, movements... ... __I find the best way for me to express myself and understand others is through music notes__ Music plays an important role in my life. I would love to share my music experiences and thought with you :heartpulse:

## Instrument Market

###### I have played music instrument since I was 5. My first instrument is piano and I still play it sometimes in the university. Later, I played the Pipa in our my primary school's Chinese traditional instruments orchestra. In my junior and high school, I have joined school's orchestra as a flutist. 

###### However, my favourite instrument is Cello. It is quite magical that I feel so connected with this instrument whenever I put the bow on the string. There is a sense of ceremony when I check my body gesture. I need to sit straight and lift my arms to delightful sound. Also, the cello

###### I would highly recommend guitar if you are looking for instrument to start your music journey. It is relatively easy to pick up a guitar and you can get much fun to sing along. Moreover, the structure of a guitar makes you quickly learn different wonderful chords, which might inspire you to write your own melodies!

## Music style

###### Music is one's another diary. Just like the nature v.s. nurture debate in psychology, there is a debate over lyrics and melody. Previously, I thinks lyrics is more important since good lyrics can excuse melody. Also, there is usually a pattern in melody even it is classical music. 
###### However, I changed my mind when I touched LoFi Hip Hop, Emo, R&B, soul and independent music. You can rarely predict how the melody flows since there is riff component in these styles. My favorite artist is Dean. Check out his song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKyMIrBClYw">Instagram</a>.

###### I enjoy being laid back and chill when listening to the music. Hope you enjoy it.
